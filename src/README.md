This project was a web application built in my third year at University, implimenting Google APIs such as maps, distance matrix directions, as well as geonames API for weather and geolocation. 

It was initially planned to use live Twitter APIs for this project but changes in payment rules meant a static set had to be implimented. 

Authors note - the final iteration of the project was hosted on a configured Azure server, after the semester finished it was powered off as to save credits. 
If needs be I can re-enable on request to show the Google oAuth working as intended, your email will also needed to be provided as it's only the developer implimentation.

To Run locally use a local webserver such as XAMPP and navigate to index.html
